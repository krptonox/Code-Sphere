//what is the use of status and created_at field in daily contributions schema?
// The 'status' field is used to indicate the status of the user's contribution for the day, such as "solved", "attempted", or "not attempted". This allows us to track the user's activity and progress on a daily basis. The 'created_at' field is used to store the date and time when a new daily contributions record is created. This helps us to keep track of when each contribution was made by the user, allowing us to analyze their activity patterns and provide insights into their problem-solving habits over time.
